Node.js Express

## MVC Architecture

This API follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. The API's structure is organized as follows:

- **Model:** Contains the classes that represent the data and business logic of the application.
- **View:** Includes the API's presentation layers, such as HTML templates or JSON response generation.
- **Controller:** Handles client requests, interacts with the models, and sends appropriate responses.

This structure helps maintain well-organized code that is separated by responsibilities, making it easier to scale and maintain the API.
